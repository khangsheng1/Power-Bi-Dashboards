# README - Sales Report Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project contains a Power BI dashboard that I created to analyze sales data. The dashboard provides insights into sales performance, trends, and key metrics that help in making data-driven decisions.

## Data Source

The data for this dashboard is sourced from the following GitHub repository:

[Sales Report Data on GitHub](https://github.com/yashsdoshi/Sales_report_using_PowerBi?tab=readme-ov-file)

This repository contains the raw data files used to create the visualizations in this Power BI report.

## Dashboard Features

- **Sales Performance Overview**: Visualizes total sales, sales by region, and sales by product category.
- **Trend Analysis**: Shows monthly and quarterly sales trends to identify growth patterns.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Displays critical KPIs such as total revenue, average order value, and customer acquisition metrics.
- **Interactive Filters**: Users can filter the data by date range, product category, and more.

## Getting Started
